# Task Cancellation Race Condition Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

We discovered a race condition in the task cancellation system that was causing 404 errors when users attempted to cancel tasks. 

### **Error Scenario:**
```
12:28:41 - app.middleware.error_handler:http_exception_handler:39 - WARNING - HTTP 404 error at /v1/ocr/tasks/664f8c11-1852-45c0-8694-8ad99abc1939/cancel: Task 664f8c11-1852-45c0-8694-8ad99abc1939 not found or already completed
```

### **Root Cause:**
The issue was caused by a race condition between:
1. **Task completion cleanup** - Tasks were immediately removed from memory when streaming completed
2. **Frontend cancellation requests** - The frontend attempted to cancel tasks just as they completed

### **Sequence of Events:**
```
12:28:41 - 🌊 Stream closes for task 664f8c11-1852-45c0-8694-8ad99abc1939
12:28:41 - 🗑️ Task cleanup removes task from streaming_queues and task_metadata
12:28:41 - 🛑 Frontend sends POST /v1/ocr/tasks/{task_id}/cancel
12:28:41 - ❌ 404 Error: Task not found (already cleaned up)
```

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Grace Period for Task Metadata**

**File:** `app/services/unified_stream_processor.py`

**Changes:**
- Modified `_cleanup_task()` to not immediately delete task metadata
- Added task status marking as "completed" instead of removal
- Implemented delayed cleanup with 30-second grace period

```python
async def _cleanup_task(self, task_id: str):
    """Cleanup task resources."""
    try:
        # Remove from streaming queues immediately to stop streaming
        if task_id in self.streaming_queues:
            del self.streaming_queues[task_id]
        
        # Clean up uploaded file
        if task_id in self.task_metadata:
            task_meta = self.task_metadata[task_id]
            file_path = task_meta.get("file_path")
            if file_path and Path(file_path).exists():
                Path(file_path).unlink()
                logger.debug(f"🗑️ Cleaned up file: {file_path}")
            
            # Mark task as completed but keep metadata for a grace period
            # This prevents race conditions with cancellation requests
            task_meta["status"] = "completed"
            task_meta["cleanup_time"] = datetime.now(UTC)
            logger.debug(f"🏁 Marked task {task_id} as completed, keeping metadata for grace period")
            
            # Schedule delayed cleanup of metadata (after 30 seconds)
            asyncio.create_task(self._delayed_metadata_cleanup(task_id))
        
        logger.debug(f"🧹 Cleaned up task {task_id}")
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Cleanup error for {task_id}: {e}")

async def _delayed_metadata_cleanup(self, task_id: str):
    """Remove task metadata after a grace period to prevent race conditions."""
    try:
        # Wait 30 seconds before final cleanup
        await asyncio.sleep(30)
        
        if task_id in self.task_metadata:
            del self.task_metadata[task_id]
            logger.debug(f"🗑️ Final cleanup of metadata for task {task_id}")
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Delayed cleanup error for {task_id}: {e}")
```

### **2. Improved Cancellation Logic**

**File:** `app/routers/unified_router.py`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced cancellation endpoint to handle multiple scenarios
- Added checks for both active and recently completed tasks
- Implemented graceful responses for race conditions

```python
async def cancel_universal_task(
    task_id: str,
    cancel_request: UnifiedTaskCancellationRequest = UnifiedTaskCancellationRequest(),
    request: Request = None
):
    """Cancel any processing task regardless of file type."""
    try:
        # Check if task exists in streaming queues (actively processing)
        is_actively_processing = task_id in unified_processor.streaming_queues
        
        # Check if task exists in metadata (recently completed or processing)
        task_meta = unified_processor.task_metadata.get(task_id)
        
        if not is_actively_processing and not task_meta:
            # Task truly doesn't exist
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=404,
                detail=f"Task {task_id} not found or already completed"
            )
        
        # If task is actively processing, perform normal cancellation
        if is_actively_processing:
            # ... normal cancellation logic ...
            logger.info(f"🛑 Cancelled active task {task_id}: {cancel_request.reason}")
            return response
        
        # If task recently completed (race condition case)
        elif task_meta and task_meta.get("status") == "completed":
            response = UnifiedTaskCancellationResponse(
                task_id=task_id,
                status="already_completed",
                message="Task was already completed before cancellation request",
                cancelled_at=datetime.now(UTC),
                cancellation_reason="Task completed before cancellation could be processed"
            )
            
            logger.info(f"ℹ️ Attempted to cancel already completed task {task_id}")
            return response
        
        # Fallback for other cases
        else:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=400,
                detail=f"Task {task_id} cannot be cancelled in its current state"
            )
```

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### **Test Script Created:**
`scripts/test_cancellation_fix.py` - Comprehensive test script that simulates both:
1. **Normal cancellation** of actively processing tasks
2. **Race condition scenarios** with completed tasks

### **Test Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Normal Cancellation**
- ✅ Start a processing task
- ✅ Cancel while actively processing
- ✅ Verify proper cancellation response

**Scenario 2: Race Condition**
- ✅ Start a processing task
- ✅ Let task complete naturally
- ✅ Immediately attempt cancellation
- ✅ Verify graceful handling with "already_completed" status

### **Expected Results:**

**Before Fix:**
```json
{
  "status_code": 404,
  "detail": "Task {task_id} not found or already completed"
}
```

**After Fix:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "664f8c11-1852-45c0-8694-8ad99abc1939",
  "status": "already_completed",
  "message": "Task was already completed before cancellation request",
  "cancelled_at": "2024-01-15T12:28:41Z",
  "cancellation_reason": "Task completed before cancellation could be processed"
}
```

- ✅ Metadata cleanup delayed only 30 seconds (minimal overhead)

### **4. Backward Compatibility**
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- ✅ Frontend can handle both "cancelled" and "already_completed" statuses
- ✅ Existing functionality remains unchanged

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

### **1. Code Changes Applied**
- [x] Modified `app/services/unified_stream_processor.py`
- [x] Modified `app/routers/unified_router.py`
- [x] Created test script `scripts/test_cancellation_fix.py`

### **2. No Database Migrations Required**
- All changes are in-memory data structures
- No schema changes needed

### **3. Testing Steps**
```bash
# 1. Start the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

```

### **4. Monitoring**
Watch for these log messages to confirm the fix is working:
```
🏁 Marked task {task_id} as completed, keeping metadata for grace period
ℹ️ Attempted to cancel already completed task {task_id}
🗑️ Final cleanup of metadata for task {task_id}
```

## 🔮 **Future Improvements**

### **Potential Enhancements:**
1. **Configurable grace period** - Make the 30-second delay configurable
2. **Metrics collection** - Track cancellation attempt patterns
3. **Frontend optimization** - Reduce unnecessary cancellation requests
4. **Batch cleanup** - Optimize memory usage for high-volume scenarios

### **Monitoring Recommendations:**
- Track cancellation success/failure rates

1. **Implementing a grace period** for task metadata cleanup
2. **Enhancing cancellation logic** to handle multiple scenarios
3. **Providing clear responses** for different cancellation states
4. **Maintaining resource efficiency** with delayed cleanup

The solution eliminates 404 errors during race conditions while maintaining system performance and providing a better user experience.
